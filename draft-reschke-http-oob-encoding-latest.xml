<section title="Introduction" anchor="introduction">
<t>
  This document describes an Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) content
  coding (<xref target="RFC7231" x:rel="#content.codings"/>) that can be used
  to describe the location of a secondary resource that contains the payload.
</t>
<t>
  The primary use case for this content coding is to enable origin servers
  to delegate the delivery of content to a secondary server that might
  be "closer" to the client (with respect to network topology) and/or
  able to cache content, leveraging content encryption, as described in
  <xref target="ENCRYPTENC"/>.

<section title="'Out-Of-Band' Content Coding" anchor="ouf-of-band.content.coding">
<section title="Overview">
<t>
  The 'Out-Of-Band' content coding is used to direct the recipient to retrieve the
  actual message representation (<xref target="RFC7231" x:rel="#representations"/>)
  from a secondary resource, such as a public cache:
</t>
<ol>
  <li anchor="flow.get.request">Client performs a request</li>
  <li anchor="flow.get.response">Received response specifies the 'out-of-band' content coding; the payload
  of the response contains additional meta data, plus the location of the secondary
  resource</li>
  <li anchor="flow.get.request2">Client performs GET request on secondary resource (usually again via HTTP(s))</li>
  <li anchor="flow.get.response2">Secondary server provides payload</li>
  <li anchor="flow.combine">Client combines above representation with additional representation metadata
  obtained from the primary resource</li>

   Client and combines payload received in (<xref target="flow.get.response2" format="counter"

/>).</artwork></figure>
</section>
<section title="Definitions">
<t>
  The name of the content coding is "out-of-band". 
</t>
<t>
  The payload format uses JavaScript Object Notation (JSON, <xref target="RFC7159"/>),
  describing an object describing secondary resources plus &OPTIONAL; additional
  metadata:
</t>
<dl>
  <dt>'URIs'</dt>
  <dd>
    A &REQUIRED; string array containing at least one URI reference (<xref target="RFC3986" x:sec="4.1"/>) of a secondary resource.
  </dd>
  <dt>'fallback'</dt>
  <dd>
    An &OPTIONAL; string containing a URI reference of a fallback resource (see <xref target="fallback"/>).
    This URI reference, after resolution against the URI of the primary resource, &MUST; identify
    a resource on the same server as the primary resource.
  </dd>
  <dt>'metadata'</dt>
  <dd>
    An &OPTIONAL; object containing additional members, representing header field values
    which can not appear as header fields in the response message itself 
    (header fields that occur multiple times need to be combined into a single field value as
    per <xref target="RFC7230" x:rel="#field.order"/>; header field names are lower-cased).
  </dd>
</dl>
<t>
  The payload format uses a JSON array so that the origin server can specify
  multiple secondary resources. When a client receives a response containing
  multiple URIs, it is free to choose which of these to use.
</t>
<t>
  New specifications can define new &OPTIONAL; header fields, thus clients
  &MUST; ignore unknown fields. Extension specifications will have to update this
  specification. <cref>or we define a registry</cref>
</t>
<t>
  The client then obtains the original message by:
</t>
<ol>
  <li>
    Unwrapping the encapsulated HTTP message by removing any transfer and content codings.
  </li>
  <li>
    Replacing/setting any response header fields from the primary
    response except for framing-related information such as
    Content-Length, Transfer-Encoding and Content-Encoding.
  </li>
  <li>
    Replacing/setting any header fields with those present as members
    in the "metadata" object.
    <cref>Do we have a use case for this?</cref>
  </li>
</ol>
<t>
  If the client is unable to retrieve the secondary resource's representation
  (host can't be reached, non 2xx response status code, payload failing
  integrity check, etc.), it can choose
  an alternate secondary resource (if specified), try the fallback URI (if
  given), or simply retry the
  request to the origin server without including "out-of-band" in the
  Accept-Encoding request header field. In the latter case, it can be useful
  to inform the origin server about what problems were encountered
  when trying to access the secondary resource; see <xref target="problem.reporting"/>
  for details.
</t>
<t>
  Note that although this mechanism causes the inclusion of external
  content, it will not affect the application-level security properties
  of the reconstructed message, such as its web origin (<xref target="RFC6454"/>).
</t>
<t>
  The cacheability of the response for the secondary resource does not affect 
  the cacheability of the reconstructed response message, which is the same as
  for the origin server's response.
</t>
<t>
  Note that because the server's response depends on the request's Accept-Encoding
  header field, the response usually will need to be declared to vary on that. See
  <xref target="RFC7231" x:fmt="of" x:rel="#header.vary"/> and
  <xref target="RFC7232" x:fmt="of" x:rel="#header.etag"/> for details.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Problem Reporting" anchor="problem.reporting">
<t>
  When the client fails to obtain the secondary resource, it can be useful
  to inform the origin server about the condition. This can be accomplished
  by adding a "Link" header field (<xref target="RFC5988"/>) to a subsequent request to the origin server,
  detailing the URI of the secondary resource and the failure reason.
</t>
<t>
  The following link extension relations are defined:

<section title="Feature Discovery" anchor="feature.discovery">
<t>
  New content codings can be deployed easily, as the client can use
  the "Accept-Encoding" header field (<xref target="RFC7231" x:rel="#header.accept-encoding"/>)
  to signal which content codings are supported.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security.considerations">
<section title="Content Modifications">
<t>
  This specification does not define means to verify that the payload
  obtained from the secondary resource really is what the origin server
  expects it to be. Content signatures can address this concern
  (see <xref target="CONTENTSIG"/> and <xref target="MICE"/>).
</t>
</section>
<section title="Content Stealing">
<t>
  The Out-Of-Band content coding could be used to circumvent the same-origin
  policy (<xref target="RFC6454" x:fmt="," x:sec="3"/>) of user agents: an
  attacking site which knows the URI of a secondary resource would use the
  out-of-band coding to trick the user agent to read the contents of the secondary resource,
  which then, due to the security properties of out-of-band codings, would be
  handled is if it originated from the origin's resource.
</t>
<t>
  This problem is not yet addressed by this specification. Possible defenses
  would be to rely on signatures and encryption, or to add an indication to
  the secondary resource's response that would prevent further processing
  in responses from "bad" origins (not unlike the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin"
  header field defined in <xref target="CORS" x:sec="5.1" x:rel="#access-control-allow-origin-response-header"/>).
</t>
</section>
<section title="Use in Requests">
<t>
  In general, content codings can be used in both requests and responses. This particular
  content coding has been designed for responses. When supported in requests, it
  creates a new attack vector where the receiving server can be tricked into
  including content that the client might not have access to otherwise
  (such as HTTP resources behind a firewall).

<section title="Alternatives, or: why not a new Status Code?" anchor="alternatives">
<t>
  A plausible alternative approach would be to implement this functionality one level
  up, using a new redirect status code (<xref target="RFC7231" x:rel="#status.3xx"/>). However, 
  this would have several drawbacks:
</t>
<ul>
  <li>Servers will need to know whether a client understands the new status code;
  thus some additional signal to opt into this protocol would always be needed.</li>
  <li>In redirect messages, representation metadata (<xref target="RFC7231" x:rel="#representation.metadata"/>),
  namely "Content-Type", applies to the response message, not the redirected-to
  resource.</li>
  <li>The origin-preserving nature of using a content coding woudld be lost.</li>
</ul>
<t>
  Another alternative would be to implement the indirection on the level
  of the media type using something similar to the type "message/external-body",
  defined in <xref target="RFC2017"/> and refined for use in the 
  Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) in <xref target="RFC4483"/>. This approach
  though would share most of the drawbacks of the status code approach mentioned 
  above.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Open Issues">
<section title="Range Requests">
<t>
  We probably need to handle Range Requests. How would this work? Passing down
  the Range request header field to the secondary resource?
</t>
<t>
  What about codes other than 200 and 206?
</t>
</section>

<section title="Accessing the Secondary Resource Too Early" anchor="fallback">
<t>
  One use-case for this protocol is to enable a system of "blind caches",
  which would serve the secondary resources. These caches might only be populated
  on demand, thus it could happen that whatever mechanism is used to populate
  the cache hasn't finished when the client hits it (maybe due to race
  conditions, or because the cache is behind a middlebox which doesn't allow
  the origin server to push content to it).
</t>
<t>
  In this particular case, it can be useful if the client was able to 
  "piggyback" the URI of the fallback for the primary resource, giving the secondary server
  a means by which it could obtain the payload itself. This information could
  be provided in yet another Link header field:
</t>
<figure>
<artwork type="message/http; msgtype=&#34;request&#34;" x:indent-with="  ">
GET bae27c36-fa6a-11e4-ae5d-00059a3c7a00 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.net
Link: &lt;http://example.com/c/bae27c36-fa6a-11e4-ae5d-00059a3c7a00>;
      rel="http://purl.org/NET/linkrel/primary-resource"

</artwork>
<postamble>
(continuing the example from <xref target="basic.example"/>)
</postamble>
</figure>
</section>

<section title="Resource maps" anchor="resource.maps">
<t>
  When out-of-band encoding is used as part of a caching solution, the additional
  round trips to the origin server can be a significant performance problem;
  in particular, when many small resources need to be loaded (such as 
  scripts, images, or video fragments). In cases like these, it could be 
  useful for the origin server to provide a "resource map", allowing
  to skip the round trips to the origin server for these mapped resources.
  Plausible ways to transmit the resource map could be: 
</t>
<ul>
  <li>
    as extension in the out-of-band encoding JSON payload, or
  </li>
  <li>
    as separate resource identified by a "Link" response header field.
  </li>
</ul>
<t>
  This specification does not define a format, nor a mechanism to transport
  the map, but it's a given that some specification using "out-of-band"
  encoding will do.
</t>
